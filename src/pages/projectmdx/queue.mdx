## Queues

A Queue is a linear data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle.

Queues typically support several operations:

- **Enqueue**: Add an element to the back of the queue.
- **Dequeue**: Remove and return the element from the front of the queue.
- **Front/Peek**: Get the element at the front of the queue without removing it.
- **IsEmpty**: Check if the queue is empty.

## Implementation of a Queue in Standard ML (SML)

Hereâ€™s a simple implementation of a queue in SML:

```sml
datatype 'a queue = Queue of 'a list * 'a list

(* Create an empty queue *)
fun emptyQueue : 'a queue = Queue ([], [])

(* Enqueue an element *)
fun enqueue (Queue (front, back), x) = Queue (front, x :: back)

(* Dequeue an element *)
fun dequeue (Queue ([], [])) = raise EmptyQueue
  | dequeue (Queue (front, back)) =
      case List.rev back of
        [] => raise EmptyQueue
      | y :: ys => (y, Queue (front, ys))

(* Peek at the front element *)
fun front (Queue ([], [])) = raise EmptyQueue
  | front (Queue (front, back)) =
      case List.rev back of
        [] => raise EmptyQueue
      | y :: _ => y

(* Check if the queue is empty *)
fun isEmpty (Queue ([], [])) = true
  | isEmpty _ = false
```
