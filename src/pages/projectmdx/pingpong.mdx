title: "Ping Pong Lua Script"
---

This Lua script continuously sends ping requests (spams pings) to a specified DNS address (defaulting to **1.1.1.1**) at a specified interval (defaulting to **1 second**). It logs the output of each ping along with a timestamp to a file named **ping_log.txt**. The script runs indefinitely until it is manually stopped, creating a record of the ping results over time.

### Key Points:

- The script defines a function to get the current timestamp in the format **YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS**.
- It uses command-line arguments to set the target DNS address and the interval for sending pings.
- Each ping result is captured using the `io.popen` function and logged to the **ping_log.txt** file.
- The script includes a loop that continues to ping at the specified interval, sleeping in between each request.

This component provides a simple yet effective way to monitor the reachability of a DNS server over time.
